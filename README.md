# Road to Big Tech the hard way

This repo is meant to:

1. Use it as a sort of second brain linked to projects repo
2. To show off either what I studied or a full-green github contribution panel

Most of all, it serves me to organize my future studies and keep track of them when I need to recall a concept. 

### Starting Point

My starting point in good enough to understand about Machine Learning, Finance and Software Engineer at an advanced level, but still far away to be called as someone who master them. 

### Journey

I won't set a final goal, which would be hard to really find. I will focus on the journey instead, in which I aim to recall some studies I did but not in order to gain a BSc or a certification: I want rebuild some basis in the hard way, learning deeply and on top of them building advanced concept. I want to avoid the mediocrity trap and be one of the best in the field.

## Rules

Doing it the hard way:

1. I am the Documentation, thy only true guide; thou shalt have no other guides before me.
2. Do ot commit copy-paste sin.
3. Honor the academic lectures, the proper books and papers. 
...
...

Long story short: no video tutorials, nor LLM for copy-pasting, but high focus on lectures, books and papers.

I want to understand and master what I learn, not just complete a project. For this reason, I will focus on understanding and on a rigid spaced repetition schedule.

Oh, and just for fun: all I'll code I will write it on NEOVIM as editor to learn movements and stuff. So it will really be the "hard way" and I can pose saying that I'm using vim, btw.
