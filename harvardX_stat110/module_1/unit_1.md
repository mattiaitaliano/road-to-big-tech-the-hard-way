# Probability and counting

If Maths is the logic of certainty, probability is the logic of uncertainty. 

## Maths Framework

The maths' framework for probability is built around sets.

1. The space S of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of the experiment

2. A or B are the subsets of space S.

3. A or B occurred if the actual **outcome** is A (or B)

If the S is finite, we can identify it and represent it. Each pebble represent an outcome and an event is a set of pebbles

For this reason, SETS are very important in probability, since they provide a way to express and works with ***events***.

### sets notation

let S be the sample space of experiment, and A, B sono sottoinsiemi di S.

1. A and B are events
2. A union B are the events that occur when either A or B occur
3. A intersection B are the events that occur only when both A and B occur
4. A complement is the event that occurs if and only if A doesn't occur.

We have then the **De Morgan's laws***:


1. (A ∪ B)c = Ac ∩ Bc

A union B complement is equal to A complement intersection B complement

This means that being a complement if the event occurs when its complementar doesn't occur (as n.4), the actions occurred complement of A union B (so all the events outside A and B) are the same of the ones describing the intersaction of A complement (all except A) and B complement (all except B). Indeed, excluding both A and B, means picking the A U B complement (all except A and B).

2. (A ∩ B)c = Ac ∪ Bc

For the same reason, saying the complement of the intersection of A and B (all where A != B) is equal to say A complement (all not A) union B complement (all not B).
