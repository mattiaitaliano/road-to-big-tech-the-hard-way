# Machine Learning

It is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Main branches:

1. Supervised learning (used the most)

2. Unsupervised learning

3. Recommender Systems

4. Reinforcement learning

Each of them have their **Algorithms**.


## Supervised Learning

Algorithms that transform input x to output label y.
Learns by being given the right answer from the supervisor.

The right answer is indeed the label y.

* Regression is a algorithm to do that (a supervised one), can be linear, curve or more difficult function. The objective remains tranform X into Y.

Other models are related to:

* Classification. Mainly differ from supervised learning because of the possible outcome. It has in fact only few numbers of possibilities (true or false, 0 and 1 etc.). So it predicts categories (or class) that don't have to be numbers but also words (cat or dog).

It works by founding a boundary line to set which part (on a graph) does this treshold classificates the outcome Y.

### Summary

So, the supervised learning learns from being given the "right answers".

Regression predict a number with infinitely many possible outputs while classification predict categories with small number of possible outputs.

## Unsupervised Learning

Differ from supervised because the Machine isn't learning by being given the right answer.
The dataset for the training isn't provided with a label "correct or incorrect", so the model will find some _patterns_ or interesting in the unlabeled data.

So, from x inputs but without labels y, algorithm has to find sttructure in the data.

* Cluster: it is an algorithm that figures out on its own what element belong to which group.Clustering means to group similiar data points together.

* Anomaly detection: to detect unusual data points, e.g. when unusual transactions mean probable frauds.

* Dimensionality reduction: compress data to fewer numbers.
