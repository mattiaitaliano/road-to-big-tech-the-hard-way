# Machine Learning

It is the field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Main branches:

1. Supervised learning (used the most)

2. Unsupervised learning

3. Recommender Systems

4. Reinforcement learning

Each of them have their **Algorithms**.


## Supervised Learning

Algorithms that transform input x to output label y.
Learns by being given the right answer from the supervisor.

The right answer is indeed the label y.

1. Regression is a algorithm, can be linear, curve or more difficult function. The objective remains tranform X into Y.
